# Tremor Challenge 2025

This repository contains the baseline model developed for the **Tremor Challenge 2025**, focused on time-series forecasting using LSTM networks. The project aims to detect patterns in tremor-related signals for predictive insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Main File

ðŸ‘‰ The primary notebook for this project is [`baseline1.ipynb`](https://github.com/norman-nhan/tremor-challenge-2025/blob/main/baseline1.ipynb), which includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Sequence generation for time-series
- LSTM model construction using Keras
- Training and evaluation pipeline

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To build a baseline LSTM model for detecting or forecasting tremor-related behavior from multivariate time-series data. This is a collaborative research initiative under the guidance of an **Assistant Professor from Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech), Japan**.
